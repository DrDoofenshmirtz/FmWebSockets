- validate WebSocket connect requests
  (1) check if not empty (may happen due to firefox 15 bug: ff15 sends two
      connect requests whenever a websocket is created, the second being empty!)
  (2) check for validity of service name, etc.: can be done in individual connection
      handlers.
- implement ping/pong
- profile memory consumption (messages...)
- document json rpc api
- polish and pack the api
